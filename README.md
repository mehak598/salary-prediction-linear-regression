# salary-prediction-linear-regression
This project implements Linear and Lasso Regression models to predict employee salaries based on experience, using Python and scikit-learn, with evaluation through MSE and R² metrics.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting employee salary based on various input features using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to build a reliable model that can estimate salary values by learning patterns from historical data.

The project is implemented in Python using a Jupyter Notebook (salary_predict.ipynb) and follows a complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

🧠 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting salaries is important for HR analytics, workforce planning, and compensation benchmarking. This project treats salary prediction as a supervised regression problem, where salary is the target variable.
